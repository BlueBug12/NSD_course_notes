## Notes
1. Use [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) to demonstrate how to make the low-level C++ available to Python
2. Use [pytest framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) and [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) to do Python unit tests
3. Use [ipybind](https://github.com/aldanor/ipybind) to do enable building and testing C++ code in Jupyter notebook
